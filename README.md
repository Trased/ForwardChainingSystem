# Predictive Inference through Forward Reasoning

This repository contains the implementation of Predictive Inference through Forward Reasoning for the Artificial Intelligence course 2024-2025. The project is developed as a Windows Forms application in C#.

## General Description

The goal of this project is to implement predictive inference through forward reasoning, using logical rules to derive conclusions from user-provided premises. The demonstration will include at least two mathematically relevant problems/theorems with simple premises.

## Technical Requirements

- Programming Language: C#
- Application Type: Windows Forms
- Platform: .NET Framework 4.7.2

## Features

1. Implementation of forward reasoning (forward chaining).
2. Graphical interface for inputting premises and displaying conclusions.
3. Two demonstration problems:
   - Example 1: Pythagorean Theorem.
   - Example 2: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
4. Extendable for other sets of rules.
